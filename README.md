The code for the paper: E. Perenda, S. Rajendran, G. Bovet, S. Pollin and M. Zheleva, "Evolutionary Optimization of Residual Neural Network Architectures for Modulation Classification," in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, vol. 8, no. 2, pp. 542-556, June 2022, doi: 10.1109/TCCN.2021.3137519.

The proposed BO-NSMA (Bi-objective Network Search Memetic Algorithm), which flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. BO-NSMA considers the block-level design and utilizes Pareto Dominance (PD) with Fitness Sharing (FS) strategy to solve the bi-objective optimization problem.
